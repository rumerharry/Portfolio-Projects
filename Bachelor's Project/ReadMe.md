# Traces of Weather in Jupiter's Upper Atmosphere
This repository contains a sample of my work surrounding the investigation of temperature variations in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter.

## Required Libraries: 
All of the libraries used my code are publically accessible, for attempts to replicate my code, you will most likely recieve an error associated with "import h3ppy". To avoid this go to "https://github.com/henrikmelin/h3ppy" and download and import ampere_utlis into your local python environment. 

## Data
All of the work containned in this repository is using data collected from NASA's IRTF telescope, this data was collected over a month period in August 2023, this data was privately sent to me, I have uploaded a sample of this dataset. 

For access to other data from the IRTF telescope visit, https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/KVQWNJ
