# Do Ultra Low Frequency Waves Exhibit an Upper Bound?
This repository contains a smaple of my work investigating Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves in Earth's magnetosphere with the aim to determine if they exhibit an
upper bound in terms of wave power. 

## Data
This project uses data that was intially collected from NASA's Van Allen probe satelite's over a five year period (2013-2018). The data shown in this repository has 
been cleaned and transformed to an extent, taking it from simple wavelength and frequency measurements into power spectral density. This process involved several stages
including windowing functions, for more details on this process read, (ADD IN KYLE MURPHY PAPER).
