# Comparing-ionospheric-vorticity-with-field-aligned-currents
This Repository contains a sample of my work surrounding the comparison of ionospheric vorticity via AMPERE and SuperDARN datasets.

# Required Libraries: 
All of the libraries used my code are publically accessible, for attempts to replicate my code, you will most likely recieve an error associated with "from ampere.utlis.plot import polar_plot". To avoid this go to "https://github.com/johncoxon/ampere-utils" and download and import ampere_utlis into your local python environment.
